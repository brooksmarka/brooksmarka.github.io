Thanks for checking out my portfolio page.  I'm a software developer from Denver, Colorado.  I enjoy learning new software languages, solving problems, running/mountain biking, and enjoying the beauty of Colorado. 

### Currently I'm working on:

* Front End Web Development
* Qualifying for the Boston Marathon
* Building relationships in the Denver tech community

If you want to learn more about my journey into development check out my blog posts.
