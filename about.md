Thanks for checking out my portfolio page. I'm a software developer from Denver, Colorado. I enjoy learning new software languages, solving problems, running/mountain biking, and enjoying the beauty of Colorado.

### Currently I'm working on:

* Front End Web Development
* Training for the Boston Marathon
* Building relationships in the Denver tech community
* Starting a Squarespace design business as a side hustle

If you want to learn more about my journey into development check out my [blog posts](http://www.mbrooks.us/).
