Thanks for checking out my portfolio page. I'm a software developer from Denver, Colorado. I enjoy learning new software languages, solving problems, running/mountain biking, and enjoying the beauty of Colorado.

### Currently I'm working on:

* A React App which lists campsites around the United States
* A spotify music clone using React
* Increasing my knowledge of Javascript and React
* Preparing to summit Mt. Rainier this summer
* Building relationships in the Denver tech community
* Running a Squarespace design business as a side hustle
