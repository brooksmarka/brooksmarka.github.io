## BlocJams Angular

To add upon my knowledge of Javascript I felt like it was time to learn a framework. Angular was chosen in the curriculum because

## What are we solving here?

As the checkpoints progressed to learn AngularJS a lot of things became apparent. AngularJS is incredibly customizable and allows for an easier and faster experience for users because of its Single Page Application (SPA) design. This allows the website to load much faster and present a streamlined user experience.

We went from a page which requires interacting with the server to a page which utilizes HTML templates to be displayed out to the user. This design allows for the same interactivity with easier implementation by the developer as well as a simple and fast user experience.

## How did we solve it?

I dove head first into concepts such as controllers, services, templates and directives which allowed me to construct an interactive website much easier. The framework allowed the website to update in real time without using vanilla Javascript event listeners. Instead angular components were used to see where button clicks were occurring.

## What did I get out of it?

While the angular framework was something to get used to it is an incredibly powerful tool to have in a developers toolbox. I believe the power lies in the ability to modularize your application. This allows you to create smaller pieces of code which can be used for different purposes. I enjoyed my introduction to angular and am excited for more.
