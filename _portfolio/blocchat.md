## Why ReactJams?

[ReactJams](https://github.com/brooksmarka/reactjams) is a Spotify clone music player which is responsive and mobile friendly. This project consisted of 10 checkpoints and assignments to teach the foundations of React and Javascript through the Bloc.io curriculum. The player is fully functional and when linked to a database would dynamically populate albums.

## What are we solving here?

We decided to take the existing BlocJams application and make it into a React App. The application allows users to quickly change from a selling intro page to a collections page where they can view the various albums. By clicking on an album you are then brought to a screen which lists songs as well as contains a player bar. The application is fully functional and responsive on various devices.

## How did we solve it?

While this project still followed the Bloc curriculum I was mainly on my own for this project. Assignments were completed with no help from a mentor (just stack overflow). I realized that the setup of a React app can be made incredibly simple by the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter package.

## What did I get out of it?

I have really begun to like React. Based upon my past experiences with vanilla javascript and the Angular framework I found this project to be much easier to grasp due to the way data flows within the React application. The ability to change state easily and keep track of that state is what makes this process fun.

I also decided to do mostly inline styling for the design of the site. I found colors what worked well together and found some background images that worked well. I even created my own logo for ReactJams!
