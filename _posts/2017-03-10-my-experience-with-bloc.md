I was introduced to coding websites in 1999 when I took a computer science class in a converted shop class garage in highschool.  

I hated it.  Nothing worked.  

I was a teenager that didn't care, and it showed in my final project.  I created a program using C++ that calculated VO2Max based upon a subjects mile time.  It made a lot of inferences but it was the best I could do at the time.  I knew there wasn't much code in there that did anything interesting. Just a few variables passed into an equation.  When I presented my project at the National Center for Astmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado the judges nodded, asked a few questions and moved on to more exciting projects.  I didn't think I could handle coding.

Since I first started to code I've picked up books here and there but never gave it much thought until I converted my Chrombook to linux using commands I found on the internet.  Having the ability to now download programs and perform tasks that many others couldn't do was very interesting to me.  I began to hop onto free sites such as CodeAcademy.com and I found the problem solving addicting. 

I started the web development program at Bloc.io in November of 2016.  I was given a mentor and was asked to complete online courses to build a foundation for the rest of the program.  This took about a month and when I was done with the foundational courses I was given an assessment which mimicked a real world technical interview.  Multiple choice questions, descriptions and a few coding problems were thrown in the mix.  I failed.  I felt like I wouldn't be able to learn the content and be an actual developer.  After talking to my mentor my fears subsided and I aced the test a week later.  I haven't met anyone who gets a little nervous before interviews and the experience of having a technical interview under my belt was definitely helpful. One of the key drivers of the Bloc.io program is being out of your comfort zone.  It is hard to do, but this is where growth happens.

Overall I'm happy with the progress I've made in the program and the mentorship is amazing.  The content and layout of the lessons could be more interactive but they get the point across in a simple manner. Each checkpoint and assignment builds on one another, although I do have to goodle quite a bit to understand what is going on.  This is most likely done on purpose to show what it is really like in a real world environment. 

The best thing about Bloc is the ability to message and converse with your mentor.  This is absolutely not something you would get taking a self-paced course unless you set something up ahead of time through a co-worker or somehow found a senior software developer looking to help you.  I love that I can meet with an experienced software engineer with over 5 years of experience every week.  My mentor is awesome and is super patient with all of my questions.  

The experience with Bloc so far has been super positive and I'm incredibly glad I made the investment to learn these skills.
