title: The Hardest Part 
---

You see it everywhere.

Cutting corners to try and save time.  You see it in faulty house construction, [faked half marathon times](http://www.marathoninvestigation.com/2017/02/runner-disqualified-after-claiming-2nd.html), or bad beer.  People consistently do less work and think that they will get the desired result.  Perhaps on occasion no one finds out or they are rewarded for being "more efficient".  Everyone knows this is wrong, but people do it anyway.

This has probably been the hardest part for me in my development career.  While working through the curriculum at Bloc there have been times when I wanted (and occasionally did) look at the solution to an assignment or checkpoint because I had become frustrated and didn't know how to proceed.  This has been the most challenging part about learning a new language.  Trying to keep focused and stay on track with the time commitments that are associated with the curriculum as well as setting aside enough time to truly learn the information.  I won't truly understand a concept unless I have put it into a real world situation and understood exactly what the wrong and right outputs are.

To combat this I'm going to deploy a few techniques.  One is asking for help once I have tried to search for the solution.  Bloc's curriculum only goes so far and without the help of the Bloc community and my mentor I would be very far behind in the course.  The weekly one-on-one sessions with my mentor definitely drive these concepts home and I'm incredibly lucky to have the mentor that I do.  The second technique is constantly telling myself that being frustrated and not knowing the answer will always be a feeling I will have as a developer.  There is always something new to learn and to always feel comfortable with where you are at can lead to stagnation.  I also keep telling myself that this is part of the learning process and you are supposed to go through these periods to come out stronger on the other end.

Don't cut corners, it is self sabotage.
