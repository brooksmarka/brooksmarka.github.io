Campfires are amazing things.

People gather around the warmth and light it provides. There is a sense of primal attraction to the fire. From an evolutionary standpoint it meant safety and security. I think this is why so many ideas and connections are made around a fire. It allows people to get to the emotional being of themselves and truly connect.

This summer I found myself around such a fire and someone asked the question "What is your unattainable dream and what is your attainable dream?" Basically what would you do if you had all the time, talent and money in the world and what would you do given your present situation. I told her my unattainable dream was being a drummer in a rockband...the attainable goal would be to live where I want, work when I want and help people.

I currently work in software sales. While I enjoy helping people (thats what sales is) I'll typically put in hard work and not get a good result. There is too much luck involved. I'd rather do fulfilling work using a skill I can control and get a specific result from. I have also learned that being tied down to customer hours and a physical location wasn't what I wanted out of life.

I wanted to see the world. I wanted to live in the mountains. I wanted to help people. I wanted to succeed and I wanted to use technology to do it.

I'm not sure I'll get all of those things, but I did want a career that allowed me to use my brain in a different way and not be tied down to customer expecations on a daily basis or be tied to a sales quota every month and stressing about not hitting it. I wanted to take back control of my life and hopefully do fulfilling work down the road.

That is the reason I'm getting into development. This is a building block to building a better life and future for myself. I want to be in a constant state of self improvement and I think this is the perfect way to do it.

In the end, the campfire was all I needed to spark these ideas and make all of this possible. I'm excited for whats next.
